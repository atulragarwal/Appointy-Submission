What I Accomplished
-------------------

I successfully implemented all 4 API's needed for functionality of the application. Currently the API's can:

2. Get User Details using ID.
3. Make Posts
4. Get Posts using Post ID
5. Get All Posts made by a User using ID
6. All user Passwords are Encrypted and Decrypted using encoding base64
7. The API's have a testing file to check their acceptability
8. The code is Reuseable, consistant and Secure

2. MongoDB 




Future Possible Functionalities
